## My process
I tackled this project with a mobile first approach. Worked from a top down fashion and styled as I went along. With the desktop view I added constraints to make the page adjust accordinly.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS media queries
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

Upon completion of this project and showing to friends, CSS variables came up in the discussion. I realised it would have helped me keep the areas where i used inline styling to a bare minimum or even none at all for cleaner and better code. Would definitely refactor this later. I didn't expect responsiveness to be this stressful. More practice to be done on that. If you notice more areas you think would be of great help kindly let me know as well.
